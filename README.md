# Well-Spent

It's true that, to a certain extent, money can buy happiness - but what matters far more than how much money you make is what you spend your money on.

Well Spent allows you to track how happy your purchases are really making you and teaches you about the relationship between your purchases and your happiness. The app allows you to log your purchases, and then it will prompt you to record how satisfied you are with that purchase over time. On the dashboard you'll see some graphs visualizing your data over time.
